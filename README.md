The programming language Python is more popular than ever. So it’s no surprise that Python back-end development — and Python back-end developers — are now in high demand.

A Python back-end developer is an IT professional who specializes in creating, testing, and managing Python code used for back-end functions. These professionals understand the web development frameworks of Python, as well as the basics of data management.

To become a Python developer, the most important skill required is — not surprisingly — knowledge of Python.

Thankfully, Python is considered one of the easiest programming languages to learn. While Python can be used to create complex functions and power in-depth web features, the basics of this language are straightforward. Beginners can start building simple programs and scripts very quickly.

Along with Python expertise, back-end developers also need a passion for problem-solving. The nature of web-based services and solutions means that they don’t always work as intended. Back-end Python developers are often tasked with unpacking potential problems to create effective solutions.

In some cases, this is easy. In others, it may require substantial time and effort. As a result, a preference for Python problem-solving is essential.
